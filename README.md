This repo was submitted as a partial requirement of computer vision course. It contains the implementation of following algorithms for Image Mosacing and corner detection.
Here we applied a Harris corner detector to find corners in two images, automatically find corresponding features, estimate a homography between the two images, and
warp one image into the coordinate system of the second one to produce a mosaic containing the union of all pixels in the two images.
